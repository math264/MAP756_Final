# MAP756_Final: Towards Modern Web Design & Development
Final Project for MAP675 -> Option 1: Dive Deeper into Mapox Studio and Mapbox GL JS
## Description:
*Using Mapbox GL JS and Turf.js to spatially analyze PennDOT's ability to maintain bridges in Pittsburgh, PA*

PennDOT maintains over 16,000 of PA's bridges a year. Using the city of Pittsburgh, PA as a large scale example, spatial analysis aids PennDOT in divvying up bridge maintenaince to its stations. There are three within city limits. The solution is an interactive map that enables the user to immediately identify bridges and their assigned stations. This workflow will utilize the following CSS and JS languages:

+ mapbox-gl-js/v2.6.1 & CSS
+ mapbox.js/plugins/turf/v3.0.11
+ d3js.org/d3.v6
